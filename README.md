Hello and welcome to my Guthub page! A bit about me... I have a Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Leeds, which is where I discovered the joys of coding, and a background in the design and manufacture of motors and generators. Despite my background, I have now pivoted my career towards Machine Learning. One of the main reasons I changed paths is because I love the complex, real world problems that can be solved with the simplicity of logic and code. In order to launch my Machine Learning carear, I am currently studing at AIcore which delivers an immersive programme to help their students in the creation and deployment of data pipelines, data cleaning, deep learning, cloud, CI/CD, and morebuild. Now I'm nearing towards the end of this course I now beleive myself to be a proficient Machine Learning Engineer, and hope soon to get the opportunity to work in this field.
