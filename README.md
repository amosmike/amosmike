Hello and welcome to my github page!

My name is Mike, and I am an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer. I have a Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Leeds, which is where I discovered the joys of coding, and a background in the design and manufacture of motors and generators. Despite my background, I have now pivoted my career towards machine learning. One of the main reasons I changed paths is because I love the problem solving that comes from coding and programming, and I possibility to apply the solutions to these problems into the real world in an ever increasing industry. I am currently studing at AIcore which delivers an immersive programme to help their students in the creation and deployment of AI, including building data pipelines, data cleaning, deep learning, cloud, CI/CD, and morebuild. With their help I beleive I am on way to be a proficient Machine Learning Engineer, and hope soon to launch my carear in this field.

Among my main set of skills, I would highlight:

🐍 Python 

🔧 Engineering 

📊 Machine Learning 

<!--🤖 Deep Learning (Tensorflow and Pytorch)-->
